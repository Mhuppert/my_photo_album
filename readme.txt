The purpose of this application is to create photo albums that I can share with my family. I would like to make something like this:

http://somino.free.fr/albumusa/accueil_us.php

In the Menu, there is the list of the different photo albums. This list will be in a table name “pages”
When we click on a page, we have this:

http://somino.free.fr/albumusa/voyage_ny.php

The different sections (title, pictures, and text) will be in a table name “chapters”
